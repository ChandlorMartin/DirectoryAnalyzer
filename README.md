# DocumentAnalyzer
This is a simple directory analyzer created using QT creator, c++, and Linux. It allows you to select a document and get some basic information on it such as the number of folders found inside, the number of files contained, and the total sizes of the selected directory.

NOTE: This does not count or access hidden files.
